# **SIMPLE SHELL**

####
**This simple shell project was done for the End of Trimester assessment by Cohort 0 of** _[ALX-Holberton](https://alx-apply.hbtn.io/auth/sign_up)_ _**in November 2020**_

##
**Audience**

######
This was created for an end of term project hence we were following a set of guidelines. The simple shell is ideal if you want to get a general idea of what happens in the different **SHELLS** we have access to. It definitely does not have all the fetures of a shell but might grow if we get a chance to play around with it some day. Requests to collaborate and grow the project will be open at the end of the end the month of October 2021.

##
**Enviroment**

######
Our project was built on Ubuntu via Vagrant in VirtualBox. This was set up as a requirement of the entire so that every student has their projects running on the same environment. 
As of now, we have not attempted to run the shell on any other environment.
